# Design Tokens

> Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system — specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.

[Style Dictionary](https://amzn.github.io/style-dictionary/#/) is a build system that allows you to define **design tokens** once, in a way for any platform or language to consume. 

1. Our design tokens are defined in [lib/styles/style_dict/tokens/](https://github.com/virtru/virtuoso-design-system/blob/master/lib/styles/style_dict/tokens/) as JSON files…

1. …built into the versions below.

Design tokens change **INFREQUENTLY**. So building them is a manual step that should be code reviewed. See [GitHub README](https://github.com/virtru/virtuoso-design-system/blob/master/README.md) for the details.

## Governance

Questions:

- When do we adopt new tokens? TBD

- How do we retire unused or under-used tokens? TBD

- How do we evolve tokens for more platforms? TBD

## Design tokens built for CSS

TBD: import these in your project with…

<pre><code>
  { cssDesignTokens }
</code></pre>

## Design tokens built for JS

TBD: import these in your project with…

<pre><code>
  { rawJsDesignTokens }
</code></pre>
