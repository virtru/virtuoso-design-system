# Meet the Virtuoso Design System

A design system is a set of reusable elements that enable _designers_ and **engineers** to create consistent products. 

1. We `decide things once` by creating building blocks.
1. We `create faster` by reusing building blocks. 
1. We `maintain quality` by nurturing each building block toward consistency, performance, and accessibility. 
1. We `focus on unique problems` by building upon solutions that have proven themselves in other products. 



## Terminology

Our design system is composed of Atoms, Molecules, and Organisms. 

Their differences are inspired by interaction design, which is the essence of how we craft our products.

|           |                    |
|-----------|--------------------|
| Atoms     |    no interactions |
| Molecules | only 1 interaction |
| Organisms |     >1 interaction |

1. **Atoms** - There is nothing smaller than an atom. Atoms are the foundation that molecules and organisms are built upon. 

2. **Molecules** - Molecules contain atoms, not other molecules. Molecules have no more than one interaction. 

3. **Organisms** - Organisms are made up of molecules and atoms. Organisms can have multiple interactions and/or states.

A set of [mockups published in InVision](https://virtru.invisionapp.com/overview/Virtuoso-Design-System-ckbbke39w196p01y3lnalydb2/screens) shows the design system library visually for reference.
